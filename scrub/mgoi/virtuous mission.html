    <h2>
      The Virtuous Mission was an infamous CIA operation in August of 1964 that
      involved a deep insertion inside the Soviet Union. A FOX agent codenamed
      Naked Snake was deployed via the world's first HALO jump in order to
      rescue a Soviet defector, the weapons scientist Nikolai Stepanovich
      Sokolov. While Snake succeeded in locating and extracting Sokolov from his
      KGB guards, he was subsequently attacked and critically injured by a
      defecting American agent. Sokolov was then re-captured, and the GRU
      officer Volgin not only seized Sokolov's project, but also unleashed an
      American-made Davy Crockett nuclear weapon on Russian citizens, creating
      an international incident. The catastrophe of the Virtuous Mission was so
      extreme that the CIA considered executing both Snake and his commanding
      officer, Major Zero. They were saved only by the need for Snake to be
      re-inserted a week later in Operation Snake Eater.

    <h2>
      In 1962, a Soviet scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov
      wished to defect to America. Sokolov was one of the Soviet Union's
      foremost weapons developers and head of the OKB-754 Design Bureau. Sokolov
      also requested that his family also defect to America. The man in charge
      of the operation was David Oh, a British-originating CIA member. The CIA
      successfully managed to sneak Sokolov's family over the Berlin Wall, and
      then Sokolov himself, although Sokolov himself ended up exhausted from
      traveling over 800 km (500 mi) during the two-week journey and was checked
      into a hospital to recover.

      However, on October 16, 1962, President John F. Kennedy received word that
      the Soviets were in the process of deploying intermediate-range ballistic
      missiles in Cuba. The President demanded that the Soviets dismantle and
      remove the missiles immediately. At the same time, he announced a naval
      blockade to prevent further missile shipments from reaching Cuba. But the
      Soviets didn't back down, instead placing their armed forces on secondary
      alert. Soviet transport ships carrying missiles continued on course toward
      Cuba. U.S. and Soviet forces went on alert for an all-out nuclear war.
      Frantic negotiations were conducted through the U.N.'s Emergency Security
      Council and unofficial channels to end the hair-trigger standoff. Finally,
      on October 28, the Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba.
      And so the world avoided a nuclear holocaust. This incident became known
      as the Cuban Missile Crisis.
