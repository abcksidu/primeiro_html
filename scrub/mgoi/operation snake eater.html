    <h2>
      Operation Snake Eater was a CIA operation conducted in Tselinoyarsk, USSR,
      in August and September 1964. Its official aims were to assassinate the
      founding member of the Cobra Unit, The Boss, and to eliminate the threat
      posed by the nuclear-armed Shagohod weapon. In truth, the entire operation
      was part of an already existing plan to recover the Philosophers' Legacy
      from Soviet hands, which had been revised in the wake of Virtuous
      Mission's failure and in particular Volgin's destruction of the Sokolov
      Design Bureau.
